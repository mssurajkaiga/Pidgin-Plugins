====Installing plugins in linux====

Once you have installed Pidgin in your system, copy the .so file into "~/.purple/plugins/" directory. 
If the plugin doesn't appear in the "Plugins" menu (it sometimes doesn't), copy it into "/usr/lib/purple-2/".

Plugins are commented. Feel free to use them and send your feedback.
